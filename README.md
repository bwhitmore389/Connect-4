# Connect-4
Turn-based Connect-4 game with computer opponent.

This project was created as a portfolio project for the Introduction to Programming course on CodeCademy. 
To create this game, I needed to primarily call on my ability to create and modify lists to ensure functionality.
After using lists to create the board, I created several functions, building the standard Connect-4 logic into the program (e.g., gravity, checking to see if a space was available, and checking to see if winning conditions were met).

Finally, the program utilizes a wile loop for fun, turn-based gameplay.
